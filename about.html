                       <h3>Who we are</h3>
                        <p>We are INDINZI, a traditional dance troupe founded in 2022, named from the verb 'kurinda', meaning 'to protect'.
                            Our name reflects our mission: to protect, preserve, and share Rwandan culture through traditional dance and music.</p>

                        <h3>Our Journey</h3>
                        <p><strong>Youth-Driven:</strong> We are composed of 80% youth, and though we started with limited cultural knowledge, we were driven by a deep thirst to learn and contribute to our heritage.</p>
                        <p><strong>Challenges and Growth:</strong> Starting as a young group, it was challenging, but our passion for our culture pushed us to grow. We committed ourselves to learning, not only for our own development but also to share and teach Rwandan culture to those who may not know it.</p>
                        <p><strong>Connecting Globally:</strong>We aim to reach out to people all over the world, from Rwandans in the diaspora to anyone who loves our culture or wishes to learn more about it. Our mission is to make the beauty of Rwandan traditions accessible and appreciated by everyone, regardless of where they are or where they come from.</p>
